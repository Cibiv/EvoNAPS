# COMMENT: The FROM_DATABASE feature can also be set manually, should a unique database source have already been added 
#          to the EvoNAPS database and you wish to refer to it. In general it is, however, recommended to leave this 
#          option unchanges (the DEFAULT is 'misc': miscallenous alignments of no particular source).
